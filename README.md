# BenchLLM

BenchLLM is a Python-based open-source library that streamlines the testing process for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered applications. It offers an intuitive and robust way to validate and score the output of your code with minimal boilerplate or configuration.

BenchLLM is actively used at [V7](https://www.v7labs.com) for improving our LLM applications and now Open Sourced under MIT License to share with the wider community

Use BenchLLM to:

- Easily set up a comprehensive testing suite for your LLMs.
- Continous integration for your langchain/agents/models.
- Elimiate flaky chains and create confidence in your code.

> **NOTE:** BenchLLM is in the early stage of development and will be subject to rapid changes.

For bug reporting, feature requests, or contributions, please open an issue or submit a pull request (PR) on our GitHub page.

## BenchLLM Testing Methodology

BenchLLM implements a distinct two-step methodology for validating your machine learning models:

1. **Testing**: This stage involves running your code against various tests and capturing the predictions produced by your model without immediate judgment or comparison.

2. **Evaluation**: During this phase, the recorded predictions are compared against the expected output. Detailed comparison reports, including pass/fail status and other metrics, are generated.

This methodical separation offers a comprehensive view of your model's performance and allows for better control and refinement of each step.

## Install

To install BenchLLM we use pip

```
pip install benchllm
```

## Usage

Start by importing the library and use the @benchllm.test decorator to mark the function you'd like to test:

```python
import benchllm

# Your custom model implementation
def run_my_model(input):
    # Your model's logic goes here.
    return some_result

@benchllm.test(suite="/path/to/test/suite") # If the tests are in the same directory, just use @benchllm.test.
def invoke_model(input: str):
    return run_my_model(input)
```

Next, prepare your tests. These are YAML/JSON files structured as follows:

```yml
input: What's 1+1? Be very terse, only numeric output
expected:
  - 2
  - 2.0
```

In the above example, the `input` is the query or instruction that your model will process, and `expected` contains the potential responses that your model should return. It's important to note that `input` can be a simple `str` or a more complex nested dictionary; BenchLLM will extract the type of the `input` argument in the Python code and load the `input` field from the YAML file accordingly.

By default, BenchLLM uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model for the `semantic` evaluator. This requires setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. If you do not want to use this default evaluator, you can specify an alternative one (discussed in further detail below):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key.

To initiate testing, use the `bench run` command:

```bash
$ bench run
```

By default, the bench run command looks for Python files implementing the @test decorator in the current directory. To target a specific file or folder, specify it directly:

```bash
$ bench run path/to/my/file.py or/path/to/folder/with/files
```

The `--retry-count` parameter allows BenchLLM to run a test multiple times, useful for models that may have variability in their outputs:

```bash
$ bench run --retry-count 5
```

BenchLLM offers multiple evaluation methods to determine if the prediction matches the test case's expected values. You can use the `--evaluator` parameter to specify the evaluation method:

There are multiple ways to evaluate if the test functions prediction matches the test cases expected values.
By default GPT-3 is used to compare the output. You can use `--evaluator` to use a different method

- `semantic`, checks semantic similarity using language models like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, or GPT-4 (`--model` parameter). Please note, for this evaluator, you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `string-match`, checks if the strings are matching (case insensitive)
- `interactive`, user manually accepts or fails tests in the terminal
- `web`, uses pywebio fora simple local web interface

The non interactive evaluators also supports `--workers N` to run in the evaluations in parallel

```bash
$ bench run --evaluator string-match --workers 5
```

### Eval

While bench run runs each test function and then evaluates their output, it can often be beneficial to separate these into two steps. For example, if you want a person to manually do the evaluation or if you want to try multiple evaluation methods on the same function.

```bash
$ bench run --no-eval
```

This will generate json files in `output/latest/predictions`
Then later you can evaluate them with

```bash
$ bench eval output/latest/predictions
```

## API

For more detailed control, BenchLLM provides an API.
You are not required to add YML/JSON tests to be able to evaluate your model.
You can instead:

- Instantiate `Test` objects
- Use a `Tester` object to generate predictions
- Use an `Evaluator` object to evaluate your model

```python
from benchllm import StringMatchEvaluator, Test, Tester

# Instantiate your Test objects
tests = [
    Test(input="What's 1+1?", expected=["2", "It's 2"]),
    Test(input="First rule of fight club?", expected=["Do not talk about fight club"]),
]

# Use a Tester object to generate predictions using any test functions
tester = Tester(my_test_function)
tester.add_tests(tests)
predictions = tester.run()

# Use an Evaluator object to evaluate your model
evaluator = StringMatchEvaluator()
evaluator.load(predictions)
results = evaluator.run()

print(results)
```

## Commands

- `bench add`: Add a new test to a suite.
- `bench tests`: List all tests in a suite.
- `bench run`: Run all or target test suites.
- `bench eval`: Runs the evaluation of an existing test run.

## Contribute

BenchLLM is developed for Python 3.10, although it may work with other Python versions as well. We recommend using a Python 3.10 environment. You can use conda or any other environment manager to set up the environment:

```bash
$ conda create --name benchllm python=3.10
$ conda activate benchllm
$ pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To run all the examples first install the examples extra dependencies

```bash
$ pip install -e ".[examples]"
```
